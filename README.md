## How to Run (Google Colab)

1) Open any notebook (`.ipynb`) from one of the folders.

2) Upload it to **Google Colab** (or open it directly from GitHub in Colab).

3) Make sure the dataset path matches your notebook:
   - If your dataset is inside the repo folder (example: `assignment1/data/...`), keep the same structure in Colab.
   - You can also upload the dataset to Colab or mount Google Drive if needed.

4) Click **Runtime → Run all**.

## Notes

- Notebooks are the main deliverables for each folder.
- Plots and results are generated directly inside the notebooks.
- If a notebook needs an extra library, it will install it inside the notebook (only when necessary).
